Project: Create a Python Telegram Bot for an AI-Driven Rice Field Monitoring System.

Objective: Develop a bot that acts as an information and alert interface for farmers. Users should be able to ask questions about their field's status (e.g., weed alerts, crop health) and receive objective, data-driven answers. The bot should also be capable of pushing automated alerts (like the ones generated by our Jetson Nano system) to subscribed users.

Core Features to Implement:

Command Handler:

/start & /help: Welcome message and list of commands.

/subscribe: Allows a user to subscribe to automated alerts for a specific field (for future use; can simulate with a user list for now).

/unsubscribe: Allows a user to unsubscribe from alerts.

Query Handler (Primary Function):

The bot should listen for messages and use a simple keyword-matching logic to provide pre-defined, objective answers based on the project's capabilities.

Example user queries and intended bot responses:

User: "Weed alert in my field?"

Bot: "Our latest scan has detected weeds in Sector B-5. GPS: [LINK_TO_GMAPS]. Recommended action: Targeted herbicide application. Type 'details' for more."

User: "How is my crop health?"

Bot: "Overall NDVI health index is 0.72, indicating good vigor. A minor nutrient deficiency was detected in the northern plot. A detailed report has been generated on your web dashboard."

User: "What is the yield prediction?"

Bot: "Based on current health and historical data, the predicted yield for your rice field (var. Basmati) is approximately 6.2 tons/hectare."

User: "What actions should I take?"

Bot: "1. Inspect weed presence at Sector B-5. 2. Consider soil amendment for nitrogen in the northern plot. Re-scan scheduled in 15 days to monitor progress."

Alert Pusher (Simulated):

Include a function (e.g., send_alert(chat_id, message)) that can be manually triggered within the code to simulate an automated alert sent from the main monitoring system. This demonstrates the push notification functionality.

Example Alert: "🚨 ALERT: New weed cluster detected in Field Alpha. View location and details: http://your-dashboard.com/alert123"

Data Structure (Simple):

Use a Python dictionary (faq_dict) to store keywords and their corresponding answers.

Use a simple list or a file (e.g., subscribers.txt) to store the chat IDs of users who have subscribed to alerts.

Technical Requirements:

Language: Python

Libraries: Use the python-telegram-bot library (v20.x). Please include the necessary import statements.

State: No need for complex conversation persistence. Simple message response is sufficient.

Simulation: Since we don't have the live Jetson Nano data feed yet, the bot's responses can be hardcoded or pulled from the faq_dict to simulate functionality.

Please provide the complete, runnable Python code (main.py) including:

Bot token initialization (use a placeholder "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE").

The command handlers (/start, /subscribe).

The message handler for user queries using the keyword dictionary.

The simulated alert function and a command or way to trigger it for testing.
